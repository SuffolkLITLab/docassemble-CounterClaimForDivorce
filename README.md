Project Biography 

My project, part of the assembly line project at Suffolk University, focused on creating an online interview for a Counter Claim for Divorce action.

Research:

My research started with basic overview of the Counter Claim for Divorce Form and how it works. This included familiarizing myself with common language used in the form, and how it should be filled out most effectively in order to mitigate any downstream errors. After editing my PDF in order to include fields, Kate Berry, the subject matter expert I worked with, made several helpful suggestions for improvement. Originally, I allowed the user of the form to type in his/her reasons for a "fault divorce" into the applicable section, however, Kate pointed out that in MA, there are a finite number of reasons a court would grant a fault divorce and as such I should change that section to checkboxes in order to make for a better UI.
